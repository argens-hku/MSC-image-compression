# Image Compression

This folder contains the work done for assignment 2 of COMP 7503 in year 20217. An average compression ratio was acheived using a combination of 3 techniques, namely:

1. 5 predictors per scan line

2. Shift coding

3. Channel preprocessing

## Folder Structure

- **Documents** contain the documents given for the assignment, including the actual question describing the challenge, as well as tutorial slides giving a guideline

- **Program Template** contains most of the program, besides the compression algorithm, such as file i/o, gui definition, etc.

- **Work** contains the actual implemented algorithm, as well as compression result and other deliverables, including a PDF which explains the methodology.

## Getting Started

- Compile using Visual Studio 2012 or later after opening VPT.vcproj under `Program Template/VPT`

- Run VPT.exe **WHERE**

- Import photos

- Press **C** for compress, optionally, press **Y**, **U**, **v**, or **YUV** to view results of part 1 of the assignment

- Examine the results at `Work/Compression results.xlsx` **CONFIRM**
